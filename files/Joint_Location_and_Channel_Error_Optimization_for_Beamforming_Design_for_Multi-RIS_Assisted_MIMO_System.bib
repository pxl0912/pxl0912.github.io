  abstract={Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been proved to be a promising approach to enhance the performance of wireless communication because of its intelligently reconfiguring the passive reflecting elements. Previous works only consider the beamforming design for a fixed RIS location/deployment and perfect channel state information (CSI). While RIS's location and perfect CSI can be further optimized to enhance the system performance. In this paper, the robust beamforming design is investigated for multi-RIS assisted multiuser millimeter wave system with imperfect CSI, where the weighted sum-rate maximization (WSM) problem is formulated. The considered WSM maximization problem includes channel estimation error, bandwidth as well as RIS placement variables, which results in a complicated nonconvex optimization problem. To handle this problem, we decouple the original problem into a series of subproblems, where the location, bandwidth, transmit beamforming and passive beamforming are optimized iteratively. Then, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm based on the penalty and gradient projection (GP) methods to alleviate the performance loss caused by the effect of imperfect CSI. Simulations validate that the proposed scheme can bring significant performance gains, especially considering its high spectral efficiency, when designing the location of RIS and imperfect CSI.},
