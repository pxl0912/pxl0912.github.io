  abstract={Power consumption and hardware cost are two of the main challenges for realizing beyond fifth generation (B5G) and sixth generation (6G) wireless communications. Recently, the emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising tool for enhancing the propagation environment and improving the spectral efficiency of wireless communications by controlling low-cost passive reflecting elements. However, current cellular communications were designed on the basis of conventional communication theories, significantly restricting the development of RIS-assisted B5G/6G technologies and leading to severe limitations. In this article, we discuss RIS-assisted channel estimation issues involved in B5G/6G communications including channel state information (CSI) acquisition, imperfect cascade CSI for beamforming design, and co-channel interference coordination, and develop a few possible solutions or visionary technologies to promote the development of B5G/6G. Finally, potential research opportunities are discussed.},
