  abstract={In this paper, we propose a compressive channel estimation technique for IRS-assisted mmWave multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) system. To reduce the training overhead, the inherent sparsity in mmWave channels is exploited. By utilizing the properties of Kronecker products, IRS-assisted mmWave channel estimation are converted into a sparse signal recovery problem, which involves two competing cost function terms (measurement error and a sparsity term). Existing sparse recovery algorithms solve the combined contradictory objectives function using a regularization parameter, which leads to a suboptimal solution. To address this concern, a hybrid multi-objective evolutionary paradigm is developed to solve the sparse recovery problem, which can overcome the difficulty in the choice of regularization parameter value. Simulation results show that under a wide range of simulation settings, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive error performance compared to existing channel estimation algorithms.},
