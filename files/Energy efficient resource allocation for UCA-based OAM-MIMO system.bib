abstract="The combination of orbital angular momentum (OAM) and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) is identified as an effective solution to improve energy efficiency (EE) in the next-generation wireless communication. According to the orthogonality of OAM, we adopt uniform circular array (UCA) to establish the transmitter and receiver of the OAM-MIMO system in this paper. Our goal is to maximize the EE of the system whilst satisfying the maximum total transmit power and the minimum capacity requirement of each mode. Due to the inter-interference of different UCA at the same mode, the optimization problem involving the power allocation of modes is non-convex, thus is difficult to solve directly. To tackle this problem, the optimization problem is transformed into two sub-problems by using the fractional programming. Then we develop a dual-layer iteration algorithm where the nonconvex power allocation problem is transformed into a convex problem by exploiting the the first-order Taylor approximation in the inner layer, and the dichotomy is used to update EE in the outer layer. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution, and demonstrate the superiority of the OAM-MIMO system over the conventional MIMO system from the perspective of EE.",
