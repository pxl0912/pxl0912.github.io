  abstract={This paper investigates the energy efficiency (EE) optimization problem for device-to-device (D2D) communications underlaying non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Our aim is to maximize the energy efficiency of the system while satisfying the constraints of transmission rate and transmission power budget. However, the considered EE optimization problem is non-convex involving joint optimization of the UAV's location, beam pattern, power control and time scheduling, which is difficult to solve directly. To tackle this problem, we develop an efficient resource allocation algorithm to decompose the original problem into several sub-problems and solve them sequentially. Specifically, we first apply the Dinkelbach method to transform the fraction problem to a subtractive-form one, and propose a mulitiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) based algorithm to optimize the beam pattern. We then optimize UAV's location and power control by applying the successive convex optimization techniques. Finally, after solving the above variables, the original problem is transformed into a single-variable problem with respect to the charging time, which is a linear problem and can be solved directly. Numerical results verify that the significant EE gain can be obtained by our proposed method as compared to the benchmark schemes.},
