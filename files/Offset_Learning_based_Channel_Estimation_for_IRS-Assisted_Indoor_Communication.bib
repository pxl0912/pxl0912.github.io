  abstract={The system capacity can be remarkably enhanced with the help of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) which has been recognized as a advanced breaking point for the beyond fifth-generation (B5G) communications. However, the accuracy of IRS channel estimation restricts the potential of IRS-assisted multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. Especially, for the resource-limited indoor applications which typically contains lots of parameters estimation calculation and is limited by the rare pilots, the practical applications encountered severe obstacles. Previous works takes the advantages of mathematical-based statistical approaches to associate the optimization issue, but the increasing of scatterers number reduces the practicality of statistical approaches in more complex situations. To obtain the accurate estimation of indoor channels with appropriate piloting overhead, an offset learning (OL)-based neural network method is proposed. The proposed estimation method can trace the channel state information (CSI) dynamically with non-prior information, which get rid of the IRS-assisted channel structure as well as indoor statistics. Moreover, a convolution neural network (CNN)-based inversion is investigated. The CNN, which owns powerful information extraction capability, is deployed to estimate the offset, it works as an offset estimation operator. Numerical results show that the proposed OL-based estimator can achieve more accurate indoor CSI with a lower complexity as compared to the benchmark schemes.},
