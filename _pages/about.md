Bio
----------

I am an Associate Professor at Shenzhen University, China. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from
Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2016, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/">Dr. Bingsheng He</a>. 
From May 2016 to August 2017, I was a Post-Doc researcher at Inria Rennes Bretagne Atlantique research center, working with <a href="https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Shadi.Ibrahim/">Dr. Shadi Ibrahim</a>. 
Since October 2017, I joined Shenzhen University as an Assistant Professor. I'm a recipient of the **IEEE-CS TCHPC Early Career Researchers Award for Excellence in High Performance Computing** and the **ACM SIGHPC China Rising Star** in 2021.

I have been actively serving the community by participating in the organizing and reviewing activities
of international conferences and journals. I have served as a PC member for international conferences in HPC,
cloud and parallel and distributed systems (USENIX FAST, ACM/IEEE SC, ACM HPDC, IEEE ICDCS,
IEEE ICPP, IEEE Cluster, ACM/IEEE CCGrid, ACM CIKM); and as a Program co-chair for the PDSW 2021/2022
(in conjunction with SC21/SC22), IEEE SmartData-2019; and as a Track co-chair for IEEE HiPC 2020 and IEEE
BigData Congress 2018; and as the Panel vice-chair for SC 2021, the Demo and Poster co-chair for ICDCS 2020. 
Most recently I am serving as a vice-chair for the ML with HPC track of SC 2022, as a co-chair for the students program of ICPP 2022, and as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Computing.

My current research interests lie in high performance computing, cloud computing, and file and storage systems. More specifically,
I’m interested in various resource optimization problems in parallel and distributed systems for efficient and
scalable big data management. My papers are published in prestigious international journals (such as IEEE
TPDS, IEEE TCC and FGCS) and proceedings (such as ACM/IEEE SC, ACM HPDC, SIGMOD, ICDE, ICDCS, ICPP, CCGrid
and Cluster). I am the recipient of the Shenzhen Overseas High-Caliber Personnel (Level C) in 2018 and leading the
Parallel and Distributed Systems Team (PDST) at Shenzhen University.
