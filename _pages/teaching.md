I teach undergraduate courses for CE students. I have several topics on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and mesh networking final year design. If you are interested, please contact me.

Curriculum and Course Development
---

Co-Create the **Shenzhen University High Performance Computing Team** (with Dr. Gang Liu) for student
cluster competitions. Give training courses to team members and lead the team participating both
national and international competition events including the [Parallel Application Challenge (PAC)](http://www.pac-hpc.com/index.php) and
[ASC Student Competition](http://www.asc-events.net/).

Co-Develop the curriculum for the **artificial intelligence (AI) specialization** for the software engineering
program at CSSE, Shenzhen University, 2020.

New course material development:

* **Parallel Computing**: build new labs (18 hours) and lecture slides.

* **Cloud Computing Engineering**: build new labs (36 hours) and lecture slides, developed for the AI
specialization program.
