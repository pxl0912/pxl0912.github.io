I have presided over one National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Fund, three provincial projects, and two State Key Laboratory open projects.

We are honored to be funded by the following grants.


NSFC General Program (2022 - 2025)
---

**_Single PI_**

Data movement across data centers greatly affects the performance of geo-distributed big data systems. Graph computing is an important type of big data applications. Geo-distributed graph computing systems suffer from large computing scale, complex communication patterns, and data movement constraints due to data privacy requirements. How to effectively utilize the hardware resources of geo-distributed systems to realize fast and private graph computing is a major challenge to big data system designers. The goal of this project is to build an accurate and unified model for geo-distributed systems and design geo-aware optimization methods for graph applications accordingly.  **(Budget: 580,000 CNY)**

Tencent “Rhino-bird” Research Fund (2020 – 2022)
---

**_Single PI_**

This project is granted to the recipients of Tencent “Rhino-bird” Open-Funded Young Researcher Award
to support young faculties exploring innovative ideas in different disciplines. There are only two recipients
in computer science in 2020. The topic of this project is focused on designing and developing efficient
and privacy-preserving big data systems running in multiple data centers. **(Budget: 60,000 CNY)**

NSFC Young Scientists Fund (2019 – 2021)
---

**_Single PI_**

This project aims at tackling the challenges of running scientific applications in the cloud, including 
single cloud region and multiple geo-distributed cloud regions. This project provide performance and cost 
efficient solutions for scientific applications, especially scientific workflows which have complicated data
dependencies. **(Budget: 260,000 CNY, with a competitive funding rate of 25.5% nationwide)**

Shenzhen Overseas High-Caliber Personnel (2019 – 2021)
---

**_Single PI_**

The Shenzhen Overseas High-Caliber Personnel is an individual research project granted to researchers
with high quality research records and good research potential. This project aims at addressing the
performance variation problem in large-scale distributed systems, in order to provide predictable and
stable performance optimization for big data applications. This project is important to different types
of distributed systems that are shared among multiple users. The project also attracted interests from
industry such as Alibaba. **(Budget: 2,700,000 CNY)**

Shenzhen STI Free Exploration Project (2019 – 2021)
---

**_Single PI_**

The Shenzhen STI Free Exploration Project is granted to young and potential researchers to perform
basic research in areas where they found important. This project targets at the system challenges in wide
area network and aims at designing new method to improve system efficiency for graph-like applications.
**(Budget: 300,000 CNY)**

NSFC-Guangdong Young Scientists Fund (2018 – 2020)
---

**_Single PI_**

This project targets at the timely and important data privacy issues. It aims at optimizing the resource
management problem for large-scale big data applications in geo-distributed clouds, where the network
performance heterogeneity and privacy constraints are the main challenges. **(Budget: 100,000 CNY)**
