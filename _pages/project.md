I'm currently leading the Parallel and Distributed Systems Team (PDST) at Shenzhen University. The research goal of the team is to make efficient, scalable and secure data management systems for big data applications in the wide area. To this end, we focus on characterizing the complicated data communication patterns of big data applications and capturing the heterogeneous features of underlying wide area infrastructures; and on designing new data management approaches to improve the performance and cost efficiency of data-intensive applications, considering data privacy concerns.

We are honored to be funded by the following grants.

NSFC General Program (2022 - 2025)

**_Single PI_**

Data movement across data centers greatly affects the performance of geo-distributed big data systems. Graph computing is an important type of big data applications. Geo-distributed graph computing systems suffer from large computing scale, complex communication patterns, and data movement constraints due to data privacy requirements. How to effectively utilize the hardware resources of geo-distributed systems to realize fast and private graph computing is a major challenge to big data system designers. The goal of this project is to build an accurate and unified model for geo-distributed systems and design geo-aware optimization methods for graph applications accordingly.  **(Budget: 580,000 CNY)**
