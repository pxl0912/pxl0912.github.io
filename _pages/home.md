I mainly research on intelligent reflective surface-assisted wireless communication technology, and my research results are fully integrated with 3G PP protocol framework, and some of them have been already applied in ZTE Corporation, domestic famous medical universities and affiliated hospitals, and written into relevant industry standards with certain importance and advancement. In addition, a US patent for 5G NR PRS positioning has been assigned (I ranked first) and successfully applied to Ericsson. In terms of projects, he has presided over 1 NSF youth fund, 3 provincial projects, and 2 open projects of State Key Laboratory; in terms of papers, he has published more than 30 SCI/EI papers, including 13 SCI papers as first author or correspondence author, 10 SCI papers above the second region of CAS, 1 highly cited/hot cited paper, and 2 invited presentations in international conferences. He has been invited to present at 2 international conferences. Currently, he is the reviewer of several international academic journals, as well as the TPC Co-Chair, TPC Member and Session Chair of international conferences; he has applied for 10 Chinese invention patents, 2 US invention patents, 1 Singapore invention patent and 1 software copyright. He received the best award of "5G Internet of Things" from ASTRI-HK Polytechnic University (ranked first).

I am an Associate Professor at Shenzhen University, China. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from
Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore in 2016. From May 2016 to August 2017, I was a
Post-Doc researcher at Inria Rennes Bretagne Atlantique research center, France. Since October 2017, I
joined Shenzhen University as an Assistant Professor. I'm a recipient of the **IEEE-CS TCHPC Early Career Researchers Award for Excellence in High Performance Computing** and the **ACM SIGHPC China Rising Star** in 2021.

I have been actively serving the HPC community by participating in the organizing and reviewing activities
of international conferences and journals. I have served as a PC member for international conferences in
cloud, HPC and parallel and distributed systems (USENIX FAST, ACM/IEEE SC, ACM HPDC, IEEE ICDCS,
IEEE ICPP, IEEE Cluster, ACM/IEEE CCGrid, ACM CIKM); and as a Program co-chair for the PDSW 2021
(in conjunction with SC21), IEEE SmartData-2019; and as a Track co-chair for the IEEE HiPC 2020, IEEE
BigData Congress 2018; and as the Panel vice-chair for SC 2021, the Demo and Poster co-chair for ICDCS 2020. Most recently I am serving as a vice-chair for the ML with HPC track of SC 2022, as a co-chair for
the students program of ICPP 2022, and as an editor for the Future Generation Computer Systems journal.
My current research interests lie in cloud computing, HPC, and file and storage systems. More specifically,
I’m interested in various resource optimization problems in parallel and distributed systems for efficient and
scalable big data management. My papers are published in prestigious international journals (such as IEEE
TPDS, IEEE TCC and FGCS) and proceedings (such as SC, HPDC, SIGMOD, ICDE, ICDCS, ICPP, CCGrid
and Cluster). I am the recipient of the Shenzhen Overseas High-Caliber Personnel in 2018 and leading the
Parallel and Distributed Systems Team (PDST) at Shenzhen University.
